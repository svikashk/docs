# How your Zepel account is structured 
{: .no_toc }

Zepel is structured into accounts, squads, features, work items, and boards.

Below is an image of how a squad with multiple features, items, and boards fit inside your account to help you seemlessly organize and track.

![Account Structure in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-account-structure.png "Zepel Structure")

Let us jump in to see what they are and how they work.

## Accounts

An account is an overarching entity that owns all your squads and houses them together under one subdomain - ```https://comapanyname.zepel.io```. An account is usually the name of your company where people are added either as a Member or an Admin.

---

## Squads 

A squad is where members of your organization come together to achieve a common goal. Squads can be named after teams such as Design or Data Science, but can also map to a product or initiative your company is working on (Android App, iOS App).

People collaborated in a squad will be automatically added to the respective account as a Member if they aren't already part of that account.

## Features

A Feature is a collection of actionable work that your team can plan, track, and execute. As members across teams start to work on this feature, you can see how the entire Feature is progressing right from here.

## List

If you are not working on a feature right now, you can add your work items inside your squad's List.

This includes things like:

- Bugs customers report
- Tech debt your team needs to work on
- Simple tasks

To put it simply, if you wouldn't name your Git branch as `feature/name-of-the-feature` then you'd put that work item inside your List.

## Items

Your Feature can be broken down into smaller chunks of executable work. They can be assigned to more than one person, have due dates, estimates, and statuses.

An item can be:

- User Story
- Task
- Subtask
- Bug
- Enhancement
- Section

![Items and its types in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-items.png "Items in Zepel")

The completion of all work items inside each Feature will determine your entire squad's progress.

## Boards

Boards in Zepel let you and your team track progress of your work items. A Board ideally represents a workflow each item flows through. 

Since most features require members from other disciplines to get involved, you can have multiple Boards in your squad, so everyone can work just the way they want.
