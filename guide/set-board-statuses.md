# Update Board Statuses
{: .no_toc }

Adding statuses to your work items help the entire team stay updated on your progress. 

By default, once you [create a squad]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/creating-your-first-project.md %}), a Default Board with ```Todo```, ```In Progress```, ```Resolved```, and ```Done``` statuses will be created for you. You can also [add a new Board]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/creating-boards.md %}) in your squad to match your own workflow.

In this article, we'll see how you can update statuses for an item.
