# Update Board Statuses

Adding statuses to your work items help the entire team stay updated on your progress. 

By default, all projects will have a Default Board with ```Todo```, ```In Progress```, ```Resolved```, and ```Done``` statuses. You can add a new Board in your project to match statuses with your workflow.
