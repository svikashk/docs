# How to integrate Github with Zepel?

{: .no_toc }

Sometimes your dev team can merge and close a pull request, but forget to complete the task. That can leave you with outdated information. With Zepel's Github integration, your developers need not worry about that at all. You can automatically move items from one status to another based on your Git workflow, track commits, create pull requests, and more!

In this article, we'll see how you can set up your Zepel account to integrate with your Github repository.

__Before you begin:__ Ensure that you have Admin permissions for the GitHub repository.

## Integrate Zepel with Github

* Once you're in your Zepel account, on the top left corner, click on your Account's name.
* From the dropdown, click on "**Account Settings**".

![Click on Settings & Members from Accounts dropdown](/guide/assets/uploads/account-settings.png "Account Settings")

* In the "**Account Settings**" popup, head over to the "**Integrations**" tab. You'll find a list of all Integrations available in Zepel in this tab.
