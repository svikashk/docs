# Importing Asana Projects into Zepel
{: .no_toc }

The one click importer will help you move your projects away from Asana and into Zepel, so you can start working on your projects from where you left off. After your project is imported, you’ll see all your Asana tasks as trackable items with assignees, due dates, statuses, and even comments right where they belong.

Moving your Asana projects onto Zepel will give you the flexibility to manage your projects just the way you want without being restricted to just Tasks.

* Access the account settings popup from the menu bar on the top left corner.
