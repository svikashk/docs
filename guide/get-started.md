# Getting Started With Zepel
{: .no_toc }

New to Zepel? Welcome! 🤗
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Zepel is the project management tool that makes it effortless for you to collect customer requests and errors from several sources, prioritize, and track its development progress every step of the way.

Once you've signed up, you are only 5 steps away from tracking progress of your development.

## Collect Requests from several sources using Streams

Streams in Zepel helps you gather all customer requests and errors logged across multiple sources such as Intercom, Canny, etc., in one place. Apart from this, your team can also create internal requests.

You can tag these requests and prioritize them as `low`, `medium`, and `high` to help you focus on the most important work at all times. Custom tags are helpful when you want to segment requests and filter them based on several conditions.

## Create a Squad

A squad represents an individual, cross-functional, self-organizing team in an organization that aims to achieve a common goal. Similarly, in Zepel also, squads are used to map to such teams and are usually named after a product or an initiative the company is working on.

*Examples of squads named after open ended products: Android App, Web App, iOS App.*

## Delegate Requests from Streams to a Squad

In addition to prioritizing requests as mentioned earlier, you can delegate to a squad by linking the prioritized request to a feature or an item. Here's how you can do it:

### Delegating Requests to a Feature
{: .no_toc }

- Click on the prioritized request that you wish to delegate 

- Under the `Link to Item/Feature` section on the right pane of the request details pop-up, enter the desired feature's name or ID.

- Or click on `Create a new feature` to delegate the request to a new feature.

### Delegating Requests to an Item
{: .no_toc }

- Click on the prioritized request that you wish to delegate 

- Under the `Link to Item/Feature` section on the right pane of the request details pop-up, enter the desired item's name or ID.

- Or click on `Create a new item` to delegate the request to a new item.

*Note: You can view the linked item/feature right below the `Link to Item/Feature` section.*

## Create Feature to plan and track progress

A Feature is a collection of users stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements. Just as how a squad might work on multiple features, you can create multiple features in Zepel and track everything that's happening in your squad.

And if you have miscellaneous work that are not part of a Feature, you can add them to your squad's List.

## Create Items

Items and its types - Stories, Enhancements, Bugs, Tasks, and Subtasks - are at the core of Zepel. You can delegate, set deadlines, and track statuses of your work. 

Once you've created a Feature inside your squad, start adding items, so you can keep your team on same page.

- To change an item's type, right click on the item and select which type you would like to change to.
- Hit __[ Tab ]__ to turn any item into a Subtask.

![Items and its types in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-items.png "Items in Zepel")

_<b>Keyboard Shortcuts:</b>_

- Turn any item into a task by typing ```-``` at the beginning of an item.
- Toggle between item types using __Ctrl + Shift + S__ (or __Cmd + Shift + S__ if you use a Mac).
- Add a Section to group similar items together by typing ```*``` at the beginning of an item.

## Add Boards for every workflow

Building features is a cross team effort. And since each team has their own way of working, you can add a Board tailor-made just for them. 

That way, when you bring in a designer to help design your new feature, or a QA team to test your completed feature, they can all work from within the Squad with a workflow that suits their need.

Go ahead, start your first squad in Zepel. It'll only take a minute to see how effortless it is to work on features with cross team collaboration and track progress across teams.
