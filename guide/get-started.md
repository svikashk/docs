## Create Feature to plan and track progress

A Feature is a collection of users stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements. A project can have multiple features, so you can track everything that's happening in your project.

And if you have miscellaneous work that are not part of a Feature, you can add them to your project's List.

## Create Items

Items and its types - Stories, Enhancements, Bugs, Tasks, and Subtasks - are at the core of Zepel. You can delegate, set deadlines, and track statuses of your work. 

Once you've created a Feature inside your project, start adding items, so you can keep your team on same page.

- To change an item's type, right click on the item and select which type you would like to change to.
- Hit __[ Tab ]__ to turn any item into a Subtask.

- Turn any item into a task by typing ```-``` at the beginning of an item.
- Toggle between item types using __Ctrl + Shift + S__ (or __Cmd + Shift + S__ if you use a Mac).
- Add a Section to group similar items together by typing ```*``` at the beginning of an item.

## Add Boards for every workflow

Building features is a cross team effort. And since each team has their own way of working, you can add a Board tailor-made just for them. 

That way, when you bring in a designer to help design your new feature, or a QA team to test your completed feature, they can all work from within the Project with a workflow that suits their need.
