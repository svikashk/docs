# Sprint Status in Zepel
{: .no_toc }

Your Sprint's status will change to:
- __Scheduled:__ When your Sprint is yet to begin.
- __In Progress:__ When your Sprint is currently in progress.
- __Completed:__ When the Sprint is completed.
- __Archived:__ When the Sprint is archived.

All Sprint's status, except archive, changes based on the Duration you've set.
