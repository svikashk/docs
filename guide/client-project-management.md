Regardless of how your team is structured, you can build software in Zepel in such a way that you never drop the ball.

Follow along with this article and see how you can level up your development process, keep all your clients updated, and deliver quality software every time.

## 1. Create your first squad

__Key Goals:__

<div class="goals">
    <img class="checkbox" src="/guide/assets/uploads/check_circle.svg" alt="checkbox">
        <div class="checkbox-card-content">
            <p class="checkbox-content">Scalable way to manage multiple clients</p>
        </div>
</div>

Creating a squad is the first thing you'll be doing once you sign up for Zepel. 

A squad in Zepel is where a cross-functional team collaborates with a client and work on developing software and features. 

To get the maximum value, services and agency teams __create a squad for each client__. This allows teams such as yours to quickly jump between squads and see where work stands for each client.

## 2. Create Features to prioritize and align everyone

__Key Goals:__

<div class="goals">
    <img class="checkbox" src="/guide/assets/uploads/check_circle.svg" alt="checkbox">
        <div class="checkbox-card-content">
            <p class="checkbox-content">Single source of all the work related to a client</p>
        </div>
</div>

<div class="goals">
    <img class="checkbox" src="/guide/assets/uploads/check_circle.svg" alt="checkbox">
        <div class="checkbox-card-content">
            <p class="checkbox-content">Align everyone on a common goal</p>
        </div>
</div>

Now that you've created a squad for your client, it's time to create Features.

A Feature in Zepel is a collection of actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - that can be tracked and executed. Each squad can have multiple Features.

__If you're already used to agile methodologies and its terminologies, think of a feature as an epic.__

This makes it effortless for people who are new to agile to get started without having to go through a steep learning curve.

## 3. Create actionable items inside your Feature

__Key Goals:__

<div class="goals">
    <img class="checkbox" src="/guide/assets/uploads/check_circle.svg" alt="checkbox">
        <div class="checkbox-card-content">
            <p class="checkbox-content">See who is working on what</p>
        </div>
</div>

<div class="goals">
    <img class="checkbox" src="/guide/assets/uploads/check_circle.svg" alt="checkbox">
        <div class="checkbox-card-content">
            <p class="checkbox-content">Get the complete picture of a specific feature</p>
        </div>
</div>

Once you've created a Feature on, its time to start adding items so you can track its progress. 

Within a Feature you can create:
1. User Stories
2. Tasks
3. Subtasks
4. Enhancements
5. Bugs
6. Sections

After you've created items to plan your Feature, you can have [conversations with clients]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/comments.md %}), add [descriptions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/description.md %}), and [upload attachments]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/attachments.md %}) to each item. And of course, all items, except Section, can have [multiple assignees]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/assign.md %}), [a status]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-board-statuses.md %}), [a due date]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-due-dates.md %}), and an [estimate]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-estimates.md %}).

![Items and its types in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-client-items.png "Items in Zepel")
<div class="caption">
<small>A quick glance tells us that the "Image Filters" feature is using Dev Board and QA Board. We can also see who is working on what and that some items are part of a Sprint.</small>
</div>
<br>

__NOTE: If you want to add miscellaneous bugs, smaller user stories, and tasks that do not belong to a Feature, you can add them to the [squad's List]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/add-miscellaneous-items.md %}) which is located above the Dashboard.__

## 4. Add a Board for each team

__Key Goals:__

<div class="goals">
    <img class="checkbox" src="/guide/assets/uploads/check_circle.svg" alt="checkbox">
        <div class="checkbox-card-content">
            <p class="checkbox-content">Manage multiple teams</p>
        </div>
</div>

<div class="goals">
    <img class="checkbox" src="/guide/assets/uploads/check_circle.svg" alt="checkbox">
        <div class="checkbox-card-content">
            <p class="checkbox-content">Manage workload for team members</p>
        </div>
</div>

When building software for a client, you'll need to bring multiple members from several teams to contribute - design, engineering, and QA.

To accomodate each team, you can add multiple Boards in Zepel. That means, for example, your designer can move a user story inside a Feature from ```Design Board - Done``` to ```Dev Board - Todo``` and easily handoff work from one team to another.

The advantages of adding a separate Board for each team includes:
- Give every team the flexibility to create custom statuses.
- [Handover work to other teams]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/move-items-across-boards.md %}) effortlessly.
- Enables you to track any item at every step. 
- See what each team is working on.
- [Manage workload]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/manage-workload.md %}) in each team.

![Boards in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-client-boards.png "Boards in Zepel")
<div class="caption">
<small>Dev Board shows all the items that are being worked on by the development team in the squad. Add filters to manage workload.</small>
</div>
