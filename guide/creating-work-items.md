Once inside your Feature, you can start adding work items:

- To change an item's type, right click on the item and select which type you would like to change to.
- Hit ```[ Tab ]``` to turn any item into a Subtask.

__Keyboard Shortcuts:__

- Turn any item into a task by typing ```-``` at the beginning of an item.
- Toggle between item types using ```Ctrl + Shift + S``` (or ````Cmd + Shift + S```` if you use a Mac).
- Add a Section to group similar items together by typing ```*``` at the beginning of an item.

If you're not working on a feature, you can add your items inside the [project's List]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/add-miscellaneous-items.md %}). Of course, every item except a Section can have [multiple assignees]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/assign.md %}), [due dates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-due-dates.md %}), [board statuses]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-board-statuses.md %}), and an [estimate]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-estimates.md %}), so you can quickly start tracking them.
