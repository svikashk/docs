# How to add Sprint duration in Zepel
{: .no_toc }

Once you've added items into your Sprint, it's now time to give it a start and an end date.

- From within your Sprint, on the Sprint information area, click on "__Set date range__".
- Select a start and an end date.
- If you wish to, set a start time for your start date and an end time for your end date as well. By default, they are ````09:00```` and ````18:00```` respectively.
- Click on Save.
