# Setting up triggers to automate workflows for Github, Bitbucket, and GitLab

{: .no_toc }

__Before you begin:__ 
- Ensure that you've [enabled the integration for Github]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/github-integration.md %}).
- Ensure that you've linked an item to at least a [commit]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/link-item-to-commit.md %}), [pull request]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/link-item-to-pull-request.md %}), or a [branch]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/link-item-to-branch.md %}).

With the Zepel's integration with GitHub, you can move any item from one status to another in a board, or even from one board to another while staying in your regular workflow. 

The event handlers in Zepel are setup on a per project basis.

<!-- * To configure event handlers in your project make sure that you've first enabled the integration for [Github]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/github-integration.md %}), [Bitbucket]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/bitbucket-integration.md %}), or [GitLab]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/gitlab-integration.md %}). -->

* Once you've enabled the integration, go to the project for which you want to setup event handlers.

* Click on "**Git Workflow Automation**" from the left sidebar.

* Select the event you would like to listen for. Currently Zepel supports "**Pull request opened**", "**Pull request merged**", and "**Commit added**" events.

* If you would like to setup this event for any branch, select "**Any**". If you're using a multi-branch development workflow, you can choose to enter the name of the branch where this event will occur.

**Note:** Branch names are case sensitive.

* Next, select the status to which you'd like to move the linked item to when the event you selected occurs. If you have more than one board within the project, the menu will auto populate with all the boards and its respective statuses for you to select.

* Click "**Create**" to create this event handler.

* You can create more event handlers and streamline your entire development process by clicking on "**Add new**".
