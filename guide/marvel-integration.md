# How to Integrate Marvel With Zepel


{: .no_toc }

Designing software prototypes and testing their usability is key to building good software. And weâ€™re well aware that Marvel is an important facilitator of this process. 


So, to help the design team effortlessly collaborate with the development team on building and testing prototypes, Zepel allows a design file from Marvel to be integrated with any Item or Feature. 

This way the design files can be accessed by any team member.

Follow the steps below to access Marvel files inside Zepel.


## **Add Marvel design links to an item**

* Hover over the desired item inside your Feature/List.
* Click on the `Expand Item` icon to the right of the item.

* Finally, click the `Add a Link` button for it to get added to the item.
*  Zepel will auto-populate a preview of the design when you click the `Preview file` button, as long as the files are `Public`.
