# Link Request to Feature or Item
{: .no_toc }

After you've prioritized your stream of requests and errors, you'd want to delegate it to your squad. You'd want to align your squad on the priorities and make sure everyone is on the same page.

By linking your prioritized request to a Feature or an Item in a specific squad, you achieve exactly this.

__Before you begin:__ Make sure you have a subscription to Zepel Streams and have requests flowing in from one of the [sources]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/streams-catalog.md %}).
