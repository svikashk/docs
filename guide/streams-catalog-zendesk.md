### Create a Trigger in Zendesk


- Head over to Zendesk's `Settings`.  

- From the left side bar, scroll down to `Business Rules` section.

- Click `Triggers`.

- Click `Add Trigger`.

![Zendesk Add Trigger](/guide/assets/uploads/streams-zendesk-add-trigger.png)

- Give your trigger a name and a description.

- Under `Conditions`, you can set under what condition you'd like to send the ticket to Zepel. You can get as creative as you'd like.

- An example condition:

Meet all of the following conditions:

1. Comment is Private

2. Comment text contains the following string `Send to Zepel`

This way, when you add `Send to Zepel` as a private comment to any ticket, the corresponding ticket will automatically be sent to Zepel.

**NOTE:** You can choose to set any type of condition that suits your business needs.

![Zendesk Trigger Conditions](/guide/assets/uploads/streams-zendesk-conditions.png)

- Once the conditions are added, under the `Actions` sections, click `Add action`.

- Select `Notify target` from the drop down menu.

![Zendesk Actions](/guide/assets/uploads/streams-zendesk-actions.png)

- You will now be presented with a list of targets you created in your account.

- Select the target name you created while creating an extension.

- Once you select the target, a JSON editor will appear below. 

- Paste the following into the JSON editor:


```
{
"id": "{{ "{{ticket.id"}}}}",
"title" : "{{ "{{ticket.title"}}}}",
"description" : "{{ "{{ticket.description"}}}}",
"url": "{{ "{{ticket.url"}}}}",
"user_name": "{{ "{{current_user.name"}}}}",
"user_email": "{{ "{{current_user.email"}}}}",
"user_id": "{{ "{{current_user.id"}}}}"
}
```


- Click `Create`.

Your Zendesk tickets will be sent to Streams in Zepel every time the trigger conditions are met.
