# Complete items in Zepel with Github integration

{: .no_toc }

Every time you close a pull request in Github, Zepel can automatically complete its respective task on Zepel so you don't have to switch back and forth. 

* Once you've connected your Zepel account with your Github repository, head over to the task in your Zepel project.
* Click on "**Expand Item**" icon.

* On the top-right corner of the single item popup, click on the "**Copy item link**".

* Head over to your Github repository and create a new pull request.
* In the pull request's description, paste the item's link.

* Click "**Create pull request**"

When you close this pull request, its respective task in Zepel will automatically get completed. And if your team has Slack integration enabled, they'll automatically be notified too.
