# How to Integrate InVision With Zepel

{: .no_toc }

Many designers prefer to use Invision for a near-live collaboration experience while designing prototypes. But for incorporating these designs into features, collaboration with developers is vital. 

For this purpose, at Zepel, a design file from Invision can be integrated with any Item or Feature and it can be accessed by the entire team at any given time. 

Implement the following steps to provide access to the design files to all your team members.


## **Add InVision links to an item**

* Hover over the desired item inside your Feature/List. 

* Click on the `Expand Item` icon to the right of the item.

* In the details pop-up that appears, `paste the full URL Link` to the Invision file under the `External Links` section.

* Finally, click the `Add a Link` button for it to get added to the item.
*  Zepel will auto-populate a preview of the design when you click the `Preview file` button, as long as the files are `Public`.
