# How to link a Zepel project with a Slack channel?

{: .no_toc }

When you link a project to Zepel, you can customize what notifications you receive about the project in your preferred Slack channel. 

Below is a list of all the notifications you can choose to receive:

- Project Member Added
- Feature Created
- Feature Owner is Set
- Feature Duration is Set
- Feature Status Changed
- Feature is marked as Completed
- Branch is linked to a Feature
- Pull Request is linked to a Feature
- Feature is completed via a Git integration

You can choose to receive these notifications on either a public or a private channel. All members in the Slack channel will be able to view the notification. However, only members who are part of the project can view/edit them inside Zepel.

## Steps to link a project with a Slack channel

* Go to the project you want to link with a Slack channel.
* On the left side-bar, click on "**Link with Slack**".
