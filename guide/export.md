*Note: The exported account data `.zip` attachment includes all your Squads and Streams data in `.csv` format. If you have multiple Squads, then you'll find in the attachment the data for each of your squads - from Boards, Features, and Lists to your Sprints. Similarly, all your Streams requests will be available as a `.csv` file within the downloaded `.zip` attachment.*
