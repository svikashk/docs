# Estimate items

Add an estimate to your work item, so you can see an approximate estimate of how long your work will take to get completed.

Estimates in Zepel are measured in points. They are useful when you'd like to view Burnup and Burndown charts for your Sprint.

### <u>Using Keyboard</u>
{: .no_toc }
- With the cursor on the item you want to estimate, type ```/e```.
- In the text field, enter a number between 0.01 and 1000.

## Aggregated Soft Estimation

When you add an estimate to a subtask, it will automatically get aggregated to its respective item.

This aggregated soft estimate is set on an item, on a Section, and on the entire Feature. This allows you to see the effort needed to complete an item, a specific section in your feature, and the entire feature itself, without having to manually set an estimate everywhere.

When you complete items, the aggregated estimation updates automatically to show you much work is completed versus how much work is pending.
