# Estimate items

Add an estimate to your work item, so you can see an approximate estimate of how long your work will take to get completed.

Estimates in Zepel are measured in points. They are useful when you'd like to view Burnup and Burndown charts for your Sprint. Or when you Filter your Feature.

### <u>Using Keyboard</u>
{: .no_toc }
- With the cursor on the item you want to estimate, type ```/e```.
- In the text field, enter a number between 0.01 and 1000.
