# How to Integrate Figma With Zepel


{: .no_toc }

Figma is one of the most widely preferred cloud-based digital design tools for teams. 


And at Zepel, we know how integral it is for designers in a team to work collaboratively with the development team on new features.

So, to help facilitate this collaboration, a design file from Figma can be integrated with any Item or Feature, to be accessible to everybody in the team.


Hereâ€™s how you can do this.

## **Add Figma design links to an item**

* Hover over the desired item inside your Feature/List.
* Click on the `Expand Item` icon to the right of the item.

* Zepel will auto-populate a preview of the design when you click the `Preview file` button, as long as the files are `Public`.
