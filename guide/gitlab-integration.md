* Click on the "**Enable**" button next to GitLab.
* Now, login to your GitLab account and visit the project you want to connect with your Zepel account.
* From within your project's settings, click on Integrations.

* Copy the "**Webhook URL**" that is generated in your Zepel account and paste it in the "**URL**" field in GitLab.
* Copy the "**Webhook Secret**" that is generated in your Zepel account and paste it in the "**Secret Token**" field in GitLab.

* Since Zepel integrates only with pull request closed event, under "**Trigger**", ensure **only** "**Merge request events**" is selected.
* Uncheck all the other options under Trigger.
