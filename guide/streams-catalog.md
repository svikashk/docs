# Sources Catalog
{: .no_toc }

Connect multiple sources with Zepel and consolidate product feedback, feature requests, and error logs from several customers in one single place.

This enables you and your team to:
- build products with context
- prioritize
- delegate priorities to squads
- align squads with the prioritized outcomes

Zepel supports the following sources:

- [Intercom]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/streams-catalog-intercom.md %})
- [Canny]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/streams-catalog-canny.md %})
- [API](https://zepel.io/developers/api/v1/#streams)
- [Internal Requests]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/streams-catalog-internal-requests.md %})
