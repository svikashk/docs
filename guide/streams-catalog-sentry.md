# How to Connect Sentry With Zepel
{: .no_toc }

Sentry helps you identify bugs, issues, or errors in your software and fix them proactively rather than address them once they’ve been raised by your customers. 

This integration enables you to create new requests or merge to existing requests in Zepel Streams. These requests can then be organized, prioritized, and delegated to specific squads to be worked on. 

This way you can ensure that the features you’re building are customer-centric.

Here’s how you set up the Sentry + Zepel integration and create or merge requests from Sentry issues.

---

**Before you begin:** Make sure you’re logged in to your Sentry account and have Streams subscription enabled in your Zepel account.

And that’s it! You’re good to go. You can now organize these requests using tags, prioritize them, and link to a feature/item.
