## Cumulative Chart

The cumulative chart in Zepel shows you how your entire project is progressing. It shows a cumulative report of all items across all the features your team is working on based on which status they are in.

Irrespective of which Board items are in, all start statuses will be shown under Todo. All end statuses will be shown under Done. And everything in between as In Progress.

We've written in detail about [how to read cumulative graph on our blog](https://blog.zepel.io/cumulative-flow-diagram/?utm_source=zepelguide&utm_medium=reports).

## Burn up and Burn down Charts

The burn up and burn down charts in Zepel shows you how your entire Sprint is progressing. You can view both of these reports based on the number of items in the Sprint or based on the estimates you've set.

Both burn up and burn down charts in Zepel will get generated only after the [Sprint's status changes to In Progress]({{ site.url }}{% link guide/sprint-duration.md %}).

If any item is completed after the Sprint's end date, it will reflect on the graph to suggest an item was completed after the Sprint's end date.
