# Using List in Zepel

Any work item that isn't part of a feature, goes into your project's List.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Sometimes, you'll find you need to work on items that don't belong to a specific feature. For example, product wide tech debts or bugs that aren't prioritized. 

These work items can be added into your project's List and can be worked on either by using Boards or Sprints.

Once a project is created, you will be taken into a List with your project's name. Like Features in Zepel, you can add user stories, tasks, subtasks, enhancements, bugs, and sections.
