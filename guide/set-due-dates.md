# Set due dates
{: .no_toc }

Due dates let you set deadlines for your work items. 

When a specific work item is not yet completed on the due date, member assigned to that item will be notified via email. That way, your team never misses another deadline and all your work items stay updated.

### <u>Using Keyboard</u>
{: .no_toc }
- With the cursor on the item you want to set a due date to, type ```/d```.
- From the calendar drop down, select a date.
- Alternatively, you can just type ```Today```, ```Tomorrow```, ```Yesterday```, ```Next Monday```, or the date.
