- From the drop down, scroll down to view all the Boards you want to push to and set a status for the work item in the new Board.

## From within a Feature/List

- Once inside the Feature/List where your work item is present, to the right extreme, the Board icon represents which Board the item currently sets at.

- Click on the Board icon.

- Using the drop down, scroll down to view all the Boards you want to push to and set a status for the work item in the new Board.
