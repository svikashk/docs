- From the Item's Details popup, click on "Board". The icon represents the Board in which this work item currently is in and the text below it is the status it is at.

- From the drop down, scroll down to view all the Boards you want to push to and set a status for the work item in the new Board.

## From within a Feature/List

- Once inside the Feature/List where your work item is present, to the right extreme, the Board icon represents which Board the item currently sets at.

- Click on the Board icon.

- Using the drop down, scroll down to view all the Boards you want to push to and set a status for the work item in the new Board.
