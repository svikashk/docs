## Can I use Zepel for free?


Absolutely! Zepel is completely free to use indefinitely with all the features you would need in a project management tool with a cap of 5 members in an account.

If you are a startup trying to get off the ground, that's another monthly bill you don't have to worry about.

## How does Zepel's pricing work?

The free version of Zepel is available for teams of up to 5 people. Zepel Standard costs $5 per user per month when billed annually and $7 per user per month when billed monthly. 

When you switch to a Standard plan you can start a 14 day trial. And you will be charged only at the end of the 14 day trial.

Do I have to wait until the end of the trial to add my card?

Nope. You can add your card details any time. 

1. Just head over to the Billing tab in your Account's Settings.

2. While you are in the middle of your trial period, click on the Add Card button and enter your card details.

## What happens when the trial period ends?

If you want to continue using Zepel after your trial ends, youâ€™ll need to add a credit card, if you haven't already. 

To do this: 

1. Go to __Account Settings__ > __Billing__. 

2. Click on the Add Card button and enter your card details.

If you decide not to add your card details at the end of the trial period, but still want to continue using Zepel, remove members from your account, so there are 5 members or fewer in your account.

## What is your refund policy like?

We have a 30-day refund policy for our Annual plan. We do not offer refunds for our Monthly plan.

## What happens when I add a 6th member into my account?

When you add a 6th member into your Zepel account, you will be charged immediately, provided you have chosen your plan and added your card details.

If you haven't added your card details, you will be prompted to add your card at the end of the trial.

## What happens when I upgrade my plan? Will I be charged for my first 5 members?

No. You will not be charged for the first 5 members.

You will be charged only from the 6th member. 

For example, if your account has 8 members and you are on the monthly plan, you will be charged only for the 3 additional members.

## How can I cancel my subscription?
