# Creating Features inside your squad

Now that you've [created a squad]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/creating-your-first-project.md %}), let us go ahead and create Features in your squad.

With Features in Zepel, you can break your squad by specific features your team is working on. That way, you get to neatly organize your entire squad and see where each feature stands.

This gives you the ability to easily organize your entire team based on the features they're working and drill into the details for each of them.
