With Features in Zepel, you can break your project by specific features your team is working on. That way, you get to neatly organize your entire project and see where each feature stands.

This gives you the ability to easily organize your entire team based on the features they're working and drill into the details for each of them.

- Since projects in Zepel can have multiple Boards, you can select a default Board for your Feature. Click on the "Set Default Feature Board" drop down. You'll see a list of boards available in your project that can be set as the default board for your feature.

- Select one board from the drop down.

- Give your Feature a description (if needed) to give your team more context.
