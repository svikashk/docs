## Collaborate into an Account

An account is where all projects your company is working live. It is usually the name of your company. So, all members of your company would be inside an account.

### <u>To collaborate members into your company account:</u>
{: .no_toc }
- Click on the name of your Company's name on the top left corner.
- From the drop down, select Account Settings.

![Click on Account Settings from the Account dropdown](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-account-settings.png "Account Settings")

- In the Account Settings pop-up, switch to Members tab.
- In the text field, enter the email address of your team member and click Invite.

By default, all projects in Zepel are private, till you specifically collaborate a project with another team member.

## Collaborate in a Project

You can choose to collaborate members in a project, so you can assign pieces of work to them and work together.

### <u>To collaborate members into a project:</u>
{: .no_toc }
- Head over to the members tab inside your project.
- In the text field, enter the email address of your team member and click Invite.

![Click on Members tab in the Project](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-project-members.png "Project Members Tab")

If a member you are trying to collaborate is not part of the account already, they will automatically get added into your account.
