# How to run Sprints using Zepel?
{: .no_toc }

Zepel gives you a dedicated view for your sprints. This gives teams an easy way to focus on the most important thing (their current sprint) at any time.

Running a scrum sprint using Zepel is as simple as following these five steps. Let’s see how.

---

## Step 1: Create items inside a Feature or List

Once you’ve created a squad for your team, you can add items inside a List or Features. We’ve previously talked about when you should use [List vs Features]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/list-vs-features.md %}). 

But here’s the quick overview.

If your team is going to create a branch with the name `feature/name-of-the-feature`, then you should [create and add items inside a Feature]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/creating-and-organizing-features-inside-your-project.md %}).

Everything else like bugs, chores, and simple tasks can be [added into the List]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/add-miscellaneous-items.md %}).

You can create as many Features as you want by clicking on the **(+)** icon from the left sidebar. On the other hand, there can be only one List per squad and that's created for you when you create the squad.

You create and [add user stories, tasks, subtasks, enhancements, or bugs]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/creating-work-items.md %}) inside a Feature or a List.

Each of these items can have:

- [assignees]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/assign.md %})
- [due dates]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-due-dates.md %})
- [estimates]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-estimates.md %})
- [descriptions]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/description.md %}) (yay for markdown!)
- [comments]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/comments.md %})
- [file attachments]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/attachments.md %})
- [external links]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/add-external-links.md %})

---

## Step 2: Create a Sprint 

You can [create a Sprint]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/create-sprint.md %}) within your squad by clicking on the **(+) button** from the left sidebar. 

Once you’ve created a Sprint and give it a name. Make sure the Sprint name is easily understandable, memorable, and is related to the sprint goal. 

This helps your team to stay aligned and focussed.

Once you’ve added the Sprint’s name, it’s time to [set a duration]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/sprint-duration.md %}) for the sprint. Make sure you **select both a start and an end date** for your sprint.

Depending on the start date you’ve selected, your sprint’s status will change to:

- **Scheduled** - If your current date is before the start date
- **In Progress** - If you’re past the start date, but not the end date.
- **Completed** - If you’re past the start and the end date.
- **Archived** - If you archived the sprint using the settings icon from the top-right corner.

For obvious reasons, you’d want to set the start date in such a way that your sprint is scheduled to begin.

## Step 3: Create a Sprint Backlog

Now that you’ve created a Sprint, it’s time to [add items and create your Sprint Backlog]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/add-sprint-items.md %}).

Adding items into the Sprint is as simple as three clicks. 

All you have to do is:
- Go to the Feature/List where the item is.
- Right click on the item you want to add to the sprint.
- From the right-click menu, select the sprint you want to add the item to.

Once you’ve added items into the Sprint, you can see how many estimation points worth of work your team will be working on during the current Sprint.

![Zepel Sprint Planning](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-sprint-planning.png)

As you can see from the above image, it's estimated to take 12 points for the sprint to be completed in 7 days. Now, you can use this information to see if all the items can be completed within the sprint duration or if you'll have to remove a few of them from the current sprint.

## Step 4: Tracking items within the Sprint

Once the Sprint begins, team members can track each item either on the Scrum Board.

Let’s look at how you can go about doing this.

**Tracking sprint items using the scrum board**

When you add items into the Sprint, Zepel will automatically add the board the items are in within the Sprint.

This means, if an item that’s in Dev Board got added to the Sprint, you’ll see that a quick access to the Dev Board from within the Sprint. 

This helps teams to quickly use this as their scrum board and keep track of the sprint. 

![Zepel Scrum Board](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-scrum-board.png)

If you prefer creating a dedicated scrum board for your sprint, you can do that too!

All you have to do is, [create a new board]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/creating-boards.md %}) inside your squad and name it as scrum board. Once that is done, move all the sprint items from their respective to the scrum board. You can click here to read how you can [move items from one board to another board]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/move-items-across-boards.md %}).

Once this is done, you’ll be able to track all the items from a dedicated scrum board.

## Step 5: Tracking sprint progress using reports

You can track your sprint’s progress using the burnup or burndown reports. These reports are automatically generated in real-time. You can view the reports either by estimation points or by the number of items in the sprint.
