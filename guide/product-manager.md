# How product managers use Zepel
{: .no_toc }

Zepel lets you go from customer requests to shipped software painlessly.

In this cycle of "*going from requests to shipped software*", Zepel lets product managers to consolidate feedback from several customers from multiple sources, prioritize them, and align the squad on the prioritized outcome. And [developers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/developers.md %}) turn these prioritized outcomes into usable software.

In this article, we'll see how you, a product manager, can use Zepel to achieve this.

## 1. Consolidate requests from customers and prioritize

Your customers share feedback, request features, and report bugs from several sources. How do you consolidate all of them from multiple customers?

By [connecting all the sources]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/streams-catalog.md %}) to Streams in Zepel, you can bring in first party data of the feedback, requests, and bugs under a single roof.

You can [merge duplicates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/prioritize-features.md %}), filter and segment your requests, and finally [prioritize]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/streams-merge.md %}) them using custom tags.

## 2. Create a Squad for your team

As a product manager, you'd want to bring all the features your team will be working on under one single squad. 

A squad in Zepel is usually named after a product or an initiative, such as Web App or Android or iOS.

You can [collaborate members of your squad]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/collaborating-team-members.md %}) who will be working on your prioritized customer feedback.

## 3. Delegate prioritized features to a squad

Now that you've prioritized your features, created a squad, and collaborated with members of your squad, you can now delegate your prioritized requests to the squad.

You can do this by [linking the request to a feature or an item]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/streams-link-to-feature-or-item.md %}) in the squad.

*You'd link your request to an item if you're working on bug fix or if the request requires you to complete a small task. If your customer requested a feature, then you'd link it to a new feature.*

Once linked, you'll be able to see the feature's progress from within the request. And when you open the linked feature or an item, you'll see it's linked to a request.

This enables you to track the progress effortlessly. And it helps your entire squad to get a context of why they're building what they're building.

## 4. Spec the Feature in detail

If you linked a prioritized request to a feature, it's time to spec it in detail, so your development team doesn't build unnecessary functionalities.

Once you create a feature, you can spec it in detail using [Markdown]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/description.md %}) with feature scope, use cases, or high level information. This makes it effortless for you to communicate with your development team.

Once spec'd, you can add user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements to derive work items for your development team.

[Adding items]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/creating-work-items.md %}) for your feature is as simple as writing on a document. Simply hit enter to create another item. And press ```Cmd + Shift + S``` if you're on a Mac (Ctrl + Shift + S on Windows) to toggle between item types.

![Items and its types in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-items.png "Items in Zepel")

[Use Descriptions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/description.md %}) to add more details to each work item. For example, product managers use description as a place to add acceptance criteria for user stories and attach files below it to share files for further references.

These items can be collaboratively worked together by your squad using either a [Sprint]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/how-to-run-sprints-in-zepel.md %}) or a [Kanban Board]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/boards.md %}). Developers can streamline their workflow using deep [GitHub]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/github-integration.md %}), [Bitbucket]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/bitbucket-integration.md %}), and [GitLab]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/gitlab-integration.md %}) integrations [among many others]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/integrations.md %}).
