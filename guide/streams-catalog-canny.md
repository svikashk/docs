# How to Connect Canny With Zepel
{: .no_toc }

Canny is a widely-preferred medium used by customers to share their feedback and request new features. 

But that's not the only place you're getting requests from, are you? You get feedback from other sources as well, such as Intercom and from your Internal team too!

To consolidate all the requests & feedback in one single place, you can connect Canny and other sources with Streams in Zepel. This allows you to group duplicate requests into one, prioritize, and align your squads on the prioritized outcomes.

Now, each time a new post is added in Canny, it's automatically pushed to Streams in Zepel. From here, you can do two things:

1. Link the request to an already existing feature or item that your squad is working on.

2. Or delegate the request to a squad by creating a new feature or item.

**Before you begin:** Make sure youâ€™re logged in to your Canny account and have Streams subscription enabled in your Zepel account.
