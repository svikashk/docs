{: .no_toc }

Streams in Zepel allows you to capture customer feedback, feature requests, and error logs from multiple tools painlessly. After all, they do come from several tools, don't they?

With Streams, you can:

- Bring requests & errors from multiple sources
- Create internal requests
- Merge duplicate requests
- Filter and segment
- Prioritize what your team should work on
- Delegate priorities to Squads
