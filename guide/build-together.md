# Build Features Together
{: .no_toc }

Building features requires members from Design, Development, and QA to come together and collaborate.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Collaboration, while building features, isn't just about assigning tasks, sharing files, or having conversations. 

While they are a part of the collaboration process, most teams resort to face to face communication or meetings if their workflow gets disrupted.

In this article, we'll see you how you can bring in members from every team together and build your next feature. All without disrupting their workflow.

## 1. Create a Project

Give your project a name. Most projects in Zepel are named after a team, like Engineering. But if you prefer naming your project after an open ended product like Web App or Mobile, that works well too! 

![All Projects in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-projects.png "Zepel Projects")

When creating a project, you'll be asked to add Boards that teams can use to track and manage their work.

---

## 2. Create Features

Once you've created a project, its time create Features. Features in Zepel is a collection of actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - that can be tracked and executed.

---

## 3. Add Items

To start tracking your feature, [add items]({{site.url}}{% link guide/creating-work-items.md %}) - User Stories, Tasks, Subtasks, Bugs, and Enhancements.. 

Use Sections to organize your Feature. [Add assignees and due dates]({{site.url}}{% link guide/add-properties.md %}) to delegate work to team members. That way, everyone knows who is working on what and help you ship your feature faster.

![Items and its types in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-items.png "Items in Zepel")

__NOTE:__ Sometimes, you'll find you need to work on items that don't belong to a specific feature. Product wide tech debts or bugs. You can quickly add them into your [project's List]({{site.url}}{% link guide/add-miscellaneous-items.md %}).

---

## 4. Add Boards

Boards in Zepel are the workflows through which items can move through. 

Items can move within a Board - from one status to another. Or from one Board to another. 

Once you've created a Items inside your Feature, its time to add a Board for every team involved in building your feature. 

With a Board tailor-made for every team, each member can work just the way they want without settling for a generic "In Progress" status. 

![Boards in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-boards.png "Boards in Zepel")

Your designer would move their work in Design Board. And once your desiger is ready with design, your front-end developer can pick it up from Design Board and start moving it across his Development Board.

## 5. Make progress with Sprint or Boards

Zepel fits the way your team works. Whether you decide to use Sprints or Kanban methodology or a combination of both, Zepel will fit and adapt to your process.

Want to run a Sprint? Simply create one, add Sprint items, and delegate work.

![Sprints in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-sprints.png "Sprints in Zepel")

If you prefer a simple Kanban process, simply push work items to a Board and [assign it to a team member]({{site.url}}{% link guide/add-properties.md %}) and watch them make progress with using [Reports]({{site.url}}{% link guide/reports.md %}).

And the best part? Your team members get to focus on just the things they care about without losing context of the big picture using our [Desktop Widget]({{site.url}}{% link guide/desktop-widget.md %}).

## 6. Watch features progress

While members from every team pick up items assigned to them move them across statuses and Boards, you can see how your feature take its shape and progress across teams.

![Track Feature Progress in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-features.png "Feature Progress")

If you want to see what each team is working on, you can simply click on their respective Board and get a quick glance of what's happening. And if you head over to Progress, you can get a quick status of how much your feature has progressed.
