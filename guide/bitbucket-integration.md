# How to integrate Bitbucket with Zepel?

{: .no_toc }

Sometimes your dev team can merge and close a pull request, but forget to update progress. That can leave you with outdated information.

When you connect your Bitbucket repository to your Zepel Squad, you can easily:

- link a Feature to a new branch,
- link Items to commit,
- link Items to pull requests,
- link a bug to a branch, and
- automate developer updates in Zepel

In this article, weâ€™ll see how you can set up your Zepel account to integrate with your Bitbucket repository.

## Integrate Zepel with Bitbucket

* Once you're inside a squad, click on "**Connect to Git**" from the left sidebar. This will open your squad's Git Settings pop-up.

* You'll be prompted to log in to your Bitbucket account, if you're logged out.

* Once you log in, you'll be asked to give Zepel permissions. Click "**Grant access**".

* Once authorized, your Zepel account will now be integrated with Bitbucket.
