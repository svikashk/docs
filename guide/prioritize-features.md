# Plan and prioritize the right features
{: .no_toc }

[Product managers]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/product-manager.md %}) use Zepel to consolidate requests from several sources, segment, and prioritize features, customer requests, and error logs.

In this article, we'll show how you can prioritize these requests and align your squad on the desired outcome painlessly.

---

## 1. Bring requests from multiple sources

Requests, features, and errors get reported from multiple sources. And they come from multiple customers.

Before you can even think about prioritization, it's important to first bring all of these requests together. 

This is where Streams comes into play.

Streams in Zepel is the easiest way for you to collect, unify, and prioritize your customers' needs. By connecting with multiple sources, you can bring in first-party data from your customers.

You can bring in product feedback from live chat apps, bugs reported via helpdesks, feature requests, errors from monitoring tools, and even internal requests.

## 2. Merge and consolidate duplicate requests

Of course, when requests come in from several sources and several customers, you're going to have a few duplicates. Especially for some of your most requested updates.

Once you've connected a few sources and have requests flowing in, you can open the duplicate requests and merge it with the original.

This way, when you look at your stream, you're less likely to feel overwhelmed by the number of requests. And you'll gain clarity into exactly how often a customer requests for a feature or a bug fix.

## 3. Segment & Filter

Of course, not all requests are equal. You might want to give your enterprise customers the red carpet treatment they expect. And to do that you'd want to gain visibility into the kind of requests they've been asking.

With [custom tags]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/streams-tags.md %}), you can tag any request as, for example, "VIP Customer", filter them, and view just those requests.

And with the ability to toggle views based on the sources you've enabled, you can combine your tagged segment and view requests based on just a specific source.

## 4. Prioritize and delegate to a squad

Now that you've filtered and segmented your requests, you can add "**High Priority**", "**Medium Priority**", or "**Low Priority**" as a tag to each of them.

You can later filter and view requests based on their priorities. This can act as a guiding view for your entire team and help align them on the prioritized outcomes.

Once you've added prioritized, you can easily delegate them to a squad. This can be achieved by linking the request either to a Feature a squad is working on or an item.

As the squad makes progress in the feature, you'll be able view their progress right next to the request.

---

## 5. Track progress of the feature

Once your features are prioritized and delegated to a squad, you can spec how the feature should behave by adding detailed user stories, tasks, and enhancements. Developers can spend time focussing on completing them by running a Sprint and tracking each of them on a Kanban Board.

As developers make progress, you'll be able to track the feature's progress all the way to its completion.
