## Getting started

### Dependencies

Docs is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Docs requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

### Quick start: Use as a GitHub Pages remote theme

1. Add Docs to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml` as a [remote theme](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/)
```yaml
remote_theme: svikashk/docs
```

### Local installation: Use the gem-based theme

1. Install the Ruby Gem
```bash
$ gem install just-the-docs
```
```yaml
# .. or add it to your your Jekyll site’s Gemfile
gem "just-the-docs"
```
2. Add Docs to your Jekyll site’s `_config.yml`
```yaml
theme: "just-the-docs"
```
3. _Optional:_ Initialize search data (creates `search-data.json`)
```bash
$ bundle exec just-the-docs rake search:init
```
3. Run you local Jekyll server
```bash
$ jekyll serve
```
```bash
# .. or if you're using a Gemfile (bundler)
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
4. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

If you're hosting your site on GitHub Pages, [set up GitHub Pages and Jekyll locally](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) so that you can more easily work in your development environment.
